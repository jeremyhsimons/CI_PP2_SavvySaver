    <p>The 404 page is where the user is directed if for whatever reason the site breaks and they cannot access a page as expected. It allows the user to navigate back to the rest of the site without clicking the back button in their browser.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Error message that appears in the event of a broken link or an error in the url in the browser's search bar.</p>
        </li>
