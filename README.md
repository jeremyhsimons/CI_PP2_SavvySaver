## Introduction
Many young people today enter adult life having no concept of how to manage their finances wisely. They have no experience saving money for large purchases and, in Western countries, are engulfed by one of the most consumerist cultures that has ever existed. This combination of factors means that many are adopting lifestyles that are not conducive to long-term financial stability. 

Savvy Saver is a website that aims to help people like this. It offers three main features that can help young people and those wishing to learn more about saving:

1. The savings calculator: a simple-to-use webform that calculates what you will save and offers a print-out of recommendations for your finances.
2. The Quiz: a small game to test the user's knowledge of some basic principles of managing money.
3. An FAQ page which seeks to answer some questions that users might have about finances, and a contact form with working email notification to submit questions that are not addressed.
