## Introduction
Many young people today enter adult life having no concept of how to manage their finances wisely. They have no experience saving money for large purchases and, in Western countries, are engulfed by one of the most consumerist cultures that has ever existed. This combination of factors means that many are adopting lifestyles that are not conducive to long-term financial stability. 

Savvy Saver is a website that aims to help people like this. It offers three main features that can help young people and those wishing to learn more about saving:

1. The savings calculator: a simple-to-use webform that calculates what you will save and offers a print-out of recommendations for your finances.
2. The Quiz: a small game to test the user's knowledge of some basic principles of managing money.
3. An FAQ page which seeks to answer some questions that users might have about finances, and a contact form with working email notification to submit questions that are not addressed.

These features aims to achieve the project goals below through offering an interactive and responsive website that gives regular visual feedback and notification of what their interactions with the site achieve.

## Design

### Design Summary
The aim of this website's design is to make the user feel like managing their personal finances is something that they can manage. The features of the site need to be simple enough to give the users confidence that what they learn here can be immediately transferred to how they manage their money. The design does not want to leave the user feeling confused and lost because that may make them feel lost and confused about managing their money and perhaps getting out of a bad financial situation.

As a result the design of this site needed to be:
* Simple.
* Intuitive.
* Offer the user feedback on their actions.
* Be interactive to aid learning.
* Be accessible so that a wide range of users can benefit from the site's features.

### Colour Scheme
[Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) was used to generate the colorscheme for this website.

<img src="readme-docs/design/colour-palate.png">

### Fonts
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import fonts into this website.

Ubuntu was chosen as the main font in the website because of it's readability and less severe/corporate style. The design of the website needs to appeal to younger users or users who might not be acquainted with good financial practices and so a colder and less-readable font would potentially deter prospective users.

Sans-serif was chosen as the back-up font - in case Ubuntu doesn't load - because of it's clear readability.

### Page layout

Each page subsequent to the landing page has a similar layout. Heading and page summary are at the top of each page and there is a sticky footer with a navigation bar at the bottom. different sections of pages or groups of information are given separate colour schemes to denote their unique function.

### Wireframes

The wireframes below were created using [figma](https://www.figma.com/). The layout for each of the pages has been designed to suit mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

    * Increased FAQ page answering more questions.
    * A greater number of quiz questions which are stored in a database and randomly selected for the user each time they play.

### Bugs

| Bug Description  | Action Taken to Fix  |
|---|---|
|Could not re-submit new calculator form data once the 'calculate' button had been pressed. |Add a statement to clear the inputs array of the previous calculation's data. |
|An error would be logged if a charity figure that was 10% of income was submitted. |Alter the conditional statement in checkRecommendations() to check if `charity <= (pay / 10)` rather than `charity < (pay / 10)`. |
|Calculator page would freeze if the form was submitted with empty fields. | Added a validation function to check if fields were null or empty strings and alert the user to make changes if needed. |
|Calculator Page would freeze if users costs field totalled more than the income sum. | Added another conditional statement to the validation function to check if income < costs and alert the user that they will not save money with this current budget, and need to re-organise it before using the calculator feature. |
|Print button would remove the user's values from the fields and reset to default "0" that is coded as the value attribute in the form's html. | Added `location.reload()` to make the print function reload the page to the default values. The print button now works as a reset button as well. |#
|EmailJS would work but would not display the user's email address and name when submitted. | Re-copied the existing code from emailjs.com and added a templateParams object to get these elements from the DOM and send them with the API. |
|Quiz feature would still mark the questions that had been submitted if the user submitted an incomplete form. | Wrap the checkAnswers function in the following if statement after the validation loop to check that all question fields had been validated: `if (i === 4) { checkAnswers(); }` |
