                    <h3>What is my take home pay and how is it different from salary?</h3>
                    <p>Your take home pay is your salary after tax and national insurance contributions (in the UK). 
                        In other words it is the sum that is paid to you in your payslip.

                    <h3>What is budgeting and how can I learn more?</h3>
                    <p>A budget is your plan for how you are going to allocate 
                        your money to different areas of your life, whether that is paying for expenses, 
                        paying off debt, investing or saving. See Martin Lewis's <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/budget-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="A link to Martin Lewis's budget-planning site (opens in new tab).">helpful article</a>

                    <p>For questions about making good financial decisions, 
                        it is worthwhile reading from experts who have more experience managing money than you. 
                        A website FAQ cannot offer the depth of wisdom that good literature can.
